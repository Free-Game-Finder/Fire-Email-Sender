The LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e extends from the end of the LGV Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes in Valence and terminates at Marseille via Avignon and Aix-en-Provence.<br>Opened in 2001, the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e is operated by SNCF\u00ae with TGV Duplex high speed trains, operating on the 25kV AC catenary system, capable of reaching 320 km/h. These revolutionary high speed trains slashed journey times to the South coast of France with TGVs now handling the vast majority of all journeys in France, covering some 750 km (470 miles) in around 3 hours \u2013 faster than some domestic airlines.<br><br>The line serves a total of 4 stations, featuring three purpose-built structures, the Gare de Valence TGV, a uniquely built multi-level station allowing easy transfer between the high speed and local services, Gare d\u2019Avignon TGV, made popular by its close proximity to Avignon city centre and Gare d'Aix-en-Provence TGV, allowing easy travel into the north of Marseille and Marseille Airport, accessible by regular bus services. The final station is Marseille-Saint-Charles - a terminus station previously built to serve the surrounding area and the French Riviera, access to this station is via the classic French main lines.<br><br>Due to the undulating nature of Southern France\u2019s terrain, the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e features many steep inclines and declines, not to mention the impressive number of vast cuttings, tunnels and viaducts that traverse the landscape, the longest tunnel being over 8 km (5 Miles) long. Not only is the outstanding scenery a wonder to behold, the LGV Med. regularly sees 300 \u2013 320 km/h operation providing a fast, reliable service with the beautiful southern France countryside flying past the upper and lower windows.<br><br>The route is equipped with the TVM430 (Transmission Voie-Machine) signalling system, a revolutionary in-cab signalling system designed for operating high speed trains in high capacity. Conventional signalling is not practical for very high speed routes, as drivers have very little time to see and react to what flies past the windscreen. TVM430 displays information in the cab telling the driver what speed he should be travelling at, without the need for conventional track-side equipment.<br>Included with the 100km Marseille to Avignon high speed route is the iconic TGV Duplex in SNCF livery.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>BAL Signalling Tutorial<br></li><li>TVM430 Signalling Tutorial<br></li><li>Marseille Saint-Charles to Avignon<br></li><li>Avignon to Marseille Saint-Charles<br></li><li>Aix-en-Provence to Marseille Depot<br></li><li>Aix-en-Provence TGV to Avignon TGV<br></li><li>Avignon TGV to Marseille Saint-Charles</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.

It was decided to expand the benefit south to Valence by building a new high-speed link, the LGV Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes.<br><br>The 115 km line opened in two stages, the first in time for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, giving people a better connection to Lyon, with the second in the summer of 1994, a connection and brand-new station was also opened to Lyon-Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport at the same time.<br><br>With the LGV Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes completed and transforming travel, the decision was then made to build a further LGV line, one which would head out of Valence and serve the south of France, the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. This final line would put Marseille on the high-speed map and allow competition with airlines who also made connections to France\u2019s capital.<br><br>Construction of the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e began in 1996, and it would stretch a total of 216 km to join with the classic approach into Marseille-Saint-Charles, with additional stations being built at Avignon and Aix-en-Provence. The line was opened to traffic in 2001.<br><br>Served by TGV\u00ae Duplex\u00ae high speed trains, the LGV Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e started carrying thousands of passengers across the south of France at 300 km/h, extending to 320 km/h along key sections of the scenic, undulating lines.<br><br>The route throughout is equipped with TVM430 (Transmission Voie-Machine), a revolutionary in-cab signalling system designed for operating high speed trains at high timetable frequencies. Conventional signalling is not practical for very high-speed routes, as drivers have very little time to see and react to what flies past the windscreen. TVM430 displays information in the cab telling the driver what speed he should be travelling at, without the need for conventional track-side equipment.
