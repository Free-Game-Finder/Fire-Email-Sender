On the murky remains of the New England coastline stands a lighthouse Sanctuary where Custodian and Chimera once performed unspeakable experiments in a prison of pain. Their tools now become yours. Explore punishing new avenues of creativity with the traps and genetic abominations used to rule this secret facility.  <br><br>The Sector 1 Arsenal Pack can be purchased and downloaded in-store, or unlocked for free using in-game currency earnable by playing Meet Your Maker.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Dreadshore Arsenal Pack contains:</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1 CUSTODIAN:\u202f  </h2><strong>- Nautilus </strong><br>Enhance the effects of defensive weaponry and increase your odds of survival against any onslaught. This armor, resembling an ancient diving suit, was developed in secret by the only prisoner to escape the lighthouse Sanctuary. Nautilus, a terror from the depths who came to drown the last of humanity.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1 TRAP:\u202f</h2> <strong>-Sentry Beam </strong><br>This trap was developed by the lighthouse Sanctuary to swiftly execute any prisoner bold enough to pursue escape. The Sentry Beam\u2019s watchful red eye uses motion-tracking to lock onto a target and emit a narrow laser beam of super-heated amplified light \u2013 perfect for slicing through fast-moving Raiders. Should the beam miss its mark, it ricochets multiple times offering additional opportunity for a chaotic, blistering kill.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1 GUARD:\u202f</h2> <strong>-Ravager </strong><br>Both ruthless brute and precise killer, the Ravager is a disturbing result of the lighthouse Sanctuary\u2019s failed cloning experiments. Its visor alters its vision to display multiple blurred targets when only one is present, causing it to simultaneously fire at each in a scattershot attack more difficult to evade than a single bolt. Efficient and aggressive, the Ravager is an imposing addition to any Outpost\u2019s defenses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1 WEAPON:\u202f </h2><strong>-Demolition Cannon </strong><br>Discovered in the Sanctuary\u2019s armory by Nautilus during his blood-soaked escape, the Demolition Cannon was used to decimate any who stood in his path. Powerful and portable, this heavy artillery delivers an explosive payload in a reusable shell for a localized explosion that causes massive damage."}]}
