It was decided to expand the benefit south to Valence by building a new high-speed link, the LGV Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes.<br><br>The 115 km line opened in two stages, the first in time for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, giving people a better connection to Lyon, with the second in the summer of 1994, a connection and brand-new station was also opened to Lyon-Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport at the same time.<br><br>With the LGV Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes completed and transforming travel, the decision was then made to build a further LGV line, one which would head out of Valence and serve the south of France, the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. This final line would put Marseille on the high-speed map and allow competition with airlines who also made connections to France\u2019s capital.<br><br>Construction of the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e began in 1996, and it would stretch a total of 216 km to join with the classic approach into Marseille-Saint-Charles, with additional stations being built at Avignon and Aix-en-Provence. The line was opened to traffic in 2001.<br><br>Served by TGV\u00ae Duplex\u00ae high speed trains, the LGV Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e started carrying thousands of passengers across the south of France at 300 km/h, extending to 320 km/h along key sections of the scenic, undulating lines.<br><br>The route throughout is equipped with TVM430 (Transmission Voie-Machine), a revolutionary in-cab signalling system designed for operating high speed trains at high timetable frequencies. Conventional signalling is not practical for very high-speed routes, as drivers have very little time to see and react to what flies past the windscreen. TVM430 displays information in the cab telling the driver what speed he should be travelling at, without the need for conventional track-side equipment. For the classic approach into Marseille however, the typical BAL signalling comes into use.<br><br>LGV Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes &amp; M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e covers the line from Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles to Lyon Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu and Gare de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry TGV, extending the original route threefold to bring a total of 309 km of breath-taking scenery and enthralling high-speed to Train Simulator.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>The LGV Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes &amp; M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e includes seven career scenarios featuring TGV High-Speed passenger activities:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[TGV] 01.
